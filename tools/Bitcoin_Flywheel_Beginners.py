    This tool uses the following assumptions to model how investments add income back into Bitcoin for wealth growth. Some are fixed, while others depend on your inputs:
    
    - **BTC Price**: Fetched in real-time (or fallback to ~$118,378 if API fails). Used for all initial BTC buys and ongoing calculations.
    - **BTC Annual Return**: Your input (default 30%). This is the average yearly growth rate for BTC, drawn from a normal distribution with 50% volatility (fixed) for simulations. Higher inputs make results more bullish.
    - **Diminishing Returns**: If checked, reduces the mean return by 5% relatively each year (e.g., year 1 full rate, year 2 = rate * 0.95, year 3 = rate * 0.95^2). Not used if uncheckedâ€”assumes constant growth.
    - **Volatility**: Fixed at 50% standard deviation. Simulates market ups/downs; results are averaged over 20 runs (fixed) for smoother projections.
    - **Dividend Yields**: MSTY fixed at 130%, WNTR at 25% (based on last 12 months, variable in reality). Custom is your input. Weighted by allocations if multiple; only used in Passive Only or Hybrid strategies.
    - **Leverage Ratio**: Calculated as 1 / (1 - LTV/100) from your LTV input. Only used in Leverage Only or Hybrid; set to 1 (no leverage) for Passive Only.
    - **Borrowing APR**: Your input in % (divided by 100 for calculations). Debt compounds annually; only used if leverage is applied.
    - **Buffer Return**: Fixed at 2% annual growth if buffer is included. Buffer covers net deficits (e.g., interest exceeding income) and is optionalâ€”set to 0 if unchecked.
    - **Reinvestment**: Positive net income (dividends minus costs) automatically adds to BTC holdings. Used in all strategies but most impactful in Passive/Hybrid.
    - **Simulations**: Fixed at 20 Monte Carlo runs per scenario for averaging volatility. No taxes, fees, or liquidations modeledâ€”focus on core BTC flywheel.
